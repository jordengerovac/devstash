# Current Feature: Add Pro Badge to Sidebar

## Status

In Progress

## Goals

- Add a PRO badge to the "Files" item type in the sidebar
- Add a PRO badge to the "Images" item type in the sidebar
- Use the ShadCN UI Badge component
- Badge should be clean and subtle
- Badge text must be "PRO" (all uppercase)

## Notes

- Only applies to the Files and Images item types (the two pro-only system types)
- Keep the badge visually unobtrusive — it's informational, not a CTA
